<h1> What You Need To Know Before You Adopt A British Shorthair?</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;">
British Shorthairs are a perfect choice if you’re looking for a new feline companion. They are popular for their puffy coats and agreeable demeanor. But there’s much more to this cat than just that!
<br><br>
Before you consider owning one, it’s important to learn more about this charming breed – from how it likes to play and eat to what its needs are. It’s best to be prepared for how to help your new cat adjust to life with you. So here are some things you need to know before you welcome a new British Shorthair to your home.</p>

<h1> British Shorthairs Love New Friends</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;">Isn’t that lucky? British Shorthairs are some of the friendliest cats you’ll ever meet. You won’t have any problems getting to know your new cat because they won’t shy away from playtime or just relaxing with you while you figure out what to do for the day.
<br><br>
They’re also very good companions for children. These kitties will happily oblige kids and their infectious energy for playing and running around. They’re also great for sharing toys with. Of course, you still need to supervise both of them when they’re playing to make sure you teach your kid how to treat them as a friend and not a plaything and to teach your cat to play nice! Your British Shorthair will treasure their playmates for life.
<br><br>
Aside from family, they are usually very comfortable with strangers too! If you have any visitors at home, they’ll be delighted to know that your cat has no problem chilling beside them. The same goes for animal strangers as well. They get along with other cats, but they also get along with dogs too! Just make sure the dog isn’t aggressive or try to build your cat’s friendship with dogs that are still puppies.
</p>

<h1>British Shorthairs are Homebodies</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;">This is good news if you’re also one yourself! Most cats are, but British Shorthairs are particularly relaxed and low-activity felines. They tend not to be hyperactive and they rarely roam around if they’re bored. They’re content to lie down and observe their surroundings when they’re not in the mood to play.
<br><br>
Their calm and quiet disposition might entice you to pick them up and cuddle them when you’re both resting at home. We don’t encourage this as British Shorthairs can be a bit fussy with physical affection. They’re friendly, but sometimes, not that friendly! Get to know your cat’s comfort levels first so you both understand the best ways to show love to each other.
<br><br>
Despite their preference to relax, we still suggest you play with them from time to time during the day. An excessively sedentary lifestyle can result in several health problems for your cat and can even result in behavioral problems such as peeing or pooping outside their litter box. </p>

<h1> Can Cats Protect Against Negative Energy?</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;"> To understand why the old Egyptians have worshiped cats and considered them Gods, it’s important to know what kind of powers they have. What can cats actually do for us? Due to our busy lifestyles, and too many concerns about work, activities, and stress, we aren’t really able to notice the signs of negative energy in our homes. However, if you have a cat in your home you can rest assured that this divine creature will sense the negative energy and protect you from it. All you need to do is observe your cat and read their signs. Here are some of the ways in which cats protect us against negative energy.</p>

<h1>What Are Cats Trying to Tell Us With Their Behavior?</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;"> If your cat gets upset when you come home or it shows some signs of agitation something is not right. The cat is trying to tell you that it recognized negative energy. This can mean that you have been in a stressful situation before you came back home or had an argument with someone. Not only will your cat react to your stress, but she will also try to calm you down. For example, you may notice your cat following you in every room, sitting next to you, and cuddling with you. In this way, cats protect you against that negative energy. In other words, she will help you get rid of the negative thoughts and stress.</p>

<h1>Your Cat is Aggressive Towards a Guest</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family=georgia;background-color:#b17740;color:black;line-height:1cm;border-style:solid;border-color:#3F6C45;text-align:justify;" >If you notice that your cat starts to behave aggressively towards a person who is visiting you, it is very likely that this person has bad intentions. In these instances, cats can even start hissing at these people that they feel have bad intentions. They will be negative toward them to protect you. Cats have great intuition and can easily recognize negative energy.</p>
